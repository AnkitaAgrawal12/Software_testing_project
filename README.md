# Client-Side User Session Testing for Blogging Website

## Project Overview

This project involves testing client-side web applications using a full-stack blogging website as the platform. The codebase, consisting of over 1000 lines, incorporates robust features to provide users with a seamless and engaging experience. Key functionalities include:

- User registration and login.
- Adding posts or articles with thumbnails.
- Exploring and interacting with content shared by other users.
- Profile updates and review sharing.
- Collaborative features to foster community engagement.

## Testing Tools and Setup

### 1. **Jest**
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed for simplicity and performance. It is widely used for testing React applications, offering:

- Unit and integration testing support.
- Powerful mocking capabilities.
- Snapshot testing and watch mode for fast feedback.

**Installation:**
npm install --save-dev jest

### 2. **Babel**
Babel is a key tool for developers building React applications. It is a free, open-source JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest JavaScript syntax in older browsers. To use Babel, install required dependencies:

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env

### 3. **Cypress**
Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework that runs directly in the browser, providing real-time feedback for testing web applications. Its ability to simulate user interactions, debug with ease, and capture detailed logs makes it ideal for testing application workflows and ensuring UI reliability.
Install Cypress via preferred package manager. 
npm install cypress --save-dev
